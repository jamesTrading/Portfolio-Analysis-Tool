# Portfolio-Analysis-Tool
These excel files are being used to give a suggested asset allocation to ETFs for the AUS portfolio and individual companies and ETFs for the US portfolio

The first file is the mean-variance analysis of some AUS ETFs. The use of ETFs is due to my lower capital, so more exposure and diversification while not trying to lose
too much money to brokerage. These ETFs were selected from a Betashares growth model, and then run using the last 2 years of their returns. On the last page of the sheet, 
the dividend included returns were solved for Sharpe optimisation which gave the weights to invest into each ETF, with a constraint that there would be no shorting of ETFs.
The dividends were then looked into to make sure they cover interest payments on the margin loan which they did by 3 times.
